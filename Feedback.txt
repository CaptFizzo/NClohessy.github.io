Tools used- webpagetest.org
Changes?- 
Added defer to javascript to improve speed
Preloading Image, and having it load after scrolling
Code Changes were necessary. 
Rationale- Most things are changed for speed. In this case, webpagetest was more applicable as Iâ€™m not too worried about how many people are visiting right now, more concerned with how it operates once people visit.
