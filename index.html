                <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>I am a student in Boise State's GIMM program. I have a deep interest in 
                learning and games. I also enjoy music of all forms greatly. 
            </p>
            <p>This website is a collection of work done through the program, with some early examples showing what has changed over time.</p>

                <p>
                  I am incredibly proud to have worked on the sound design and music half of the 2024 animation "Microchip Makers," an animation made for Boise State Universitiy's MER Institute. 
                  From conception to completion, I worked alongside the animation team to create a song in the spirit of Schoolhouse Rock. I was personally responsible for writing, recording, and mixing the song, as well as editing the sound effects for the animation.

                <h2>GIMM Immersive Game (2024)</h2>
                <p>
                   This game was a great joy to work on from start to finish, and one in which I was responsible for all aspects. 
                   The game was built in Unity, and is running on a Meta Quest 2. The goal of the game was to smash all the cars as quickly as possible, using destructible enviroments to the player's advantage.
                   I took great joy in working to get the feeling of scale and power across to the player, and I am very proud of the final product.

            <h2>Drum Duels (2024)</h2>
            <p>
               Drum Duels was a project I worked on alongside 2 other students in Unreal Engine 5. I was responsible for the music and the physical wiring of our Arduino drumpad controller. 
               This project was my first experience with Unreal Engine 5. The goal was to create an accessible and fun rhythm game that could be played by anyone, regardless of musical experience.

                    <p>
                        This project was my first foray into VR projects. It used a 360° camera and involved 3d sound and editing, as well as VR interaction. To start from nothing and end with a narrative interactive story in VR was very exciting. It also further reinforced teamwork and project managment skills.

            <h2>R.O.G.E.R.</h2>
            <p>
                R.O.G.E.R. was the final product of a course of physical programming. In short, he’s a basic rotating robot that attempts to fling grapes at things that get too close. By building him, I learned how to solder, work with wires, digital inputs and outputs, motors, and putting circuit diagrams into reality.

            <h2>Data Visualization Website</h2>
            <p>
                Working on this website was my first interaction with backend programming. Trying to make a data visualization update and change for whatever data selected in a generative table was a test of my problem solving skills that I am very proud of. I haven’t had such a great feeling of satisfaction upon project completion before.
